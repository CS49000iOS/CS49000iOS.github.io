<h2>Exams/Quizzes</h2>
<div>

<p>
No exams or quizzes!
</p>

</div>

<h2>Textbook/Resources/Requirements</h2>
<div>

<p>
There is NO REQUIRED textbook for this class. Since Swift is a relatively new and changing language the best resources right now are websites. Suggested resources:
</p>

</div>
<div>
  <ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com">raywenderlich.com</a>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.appcoda.com">AppCoda</a>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/resources/">Apple Swift resources</a>
  </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>
Xcode allows for you to run your application on a device simulator.  So a physical iOS device is not required, but strongly recommended.
</p>

<h2>Policies</h2>
<p>For the most part class policies will be the same as CodePath's unless there is a conflict with a Purdue policy which will then supersede the CodePath policy.</p>
<h3>Academic Integrity Policy</h3>
<div>
<div>
<p>
Purdue University values intellectual integrity and the highest standards of academic conduct. To know and understand what is academic integrity, what is expected from you, and what you should NOT do, read carefully this document: <a href="http://spaf.cerias.purdue.edu/integrity.html" class="urlextern" title="http://spaf.cerias.purdue.edu/integrity.html" rel="nofollow"> Academic Integrity</a>.
</p>
</div>

<p>

<h3>Penalties</h3>
<div>

<p>
In CS49000-IOS, a first instance of academic dishonesty results in a zero for that assignment. A second instance of academic dishonesty results in a grade of F.
</p>

<p>
In accordance with the Purdue University Department of Computer Science Academic Integrity Policy, all instances of academic dishonesty on an exam, project, or lab assignment are reported to the Dean of Students Office.
</p>

<h2>Emergency Preparedness</h2>
<div>

<p>
To report an emergency, <strong>call 911</strong>. To obtain updates regarding an ongoing emergency, sign up for Purdue Alert text messages, view <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/ea" class="urlextern" title="http://www.purdue.edu/ea" rel="nofollow">www.purdue.edu/ea</a>.

There are nearly 300 <strong>Emergency Telephones</strong> outdoors across campus and in parking garages that connect directly to the PUPD. If you feel threatened or need help, push the button and you will be connected immediately.
</p>

<p>
If we hear a <strong>fire alarm</strong> during class we will immediately suspend class, evacuate the building, and proceed outdoors. <em><strong>Do not use the elevator</strong></em>.
</p>

<p>
If we are notified during class of a <strong>Shelter in Place requirement for a tornado warning</strong>, we will suspend class and shelter in [the basement].
</p>

<p>
If we are notified during class of a <strong>Shelter in Place requirement for a hazardous materials release, or a civil disturbance</strong>, including a shooting or other use of weapons, we will suspend class and shelter in the classroom, shutting the door and turning off the lights.
</p>

<h3>Changes for Emergencies</h3>
<div>

<p>
In the event of a major campus emergency, course requirements, deadlines and grading percentages are subject to changes that may be necessitated by a revised semester calendar or other circumstances beyond the instructor’s control. If an emergency occurs, you can consult the Purdue web page (<a href="http://www.purdue.edu" class="urlextern" title="http://www.purdue.edu" rel="nofollow">http://www.purdue.edu</a>).
